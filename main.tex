\section{Introduction}
This literature review will cover the content and background of \citetitle{shurHybridRANSLESApproach2008}\cite{shurHybridRANSLESApproach2008}. 

\section{Work Summary}
This work introduces a new hybrid RANS-LES turbulence model, which was later dubbed improved delayed detached eddy simulation (IDDES). This model builds on previous work on hybrid turbulence models by introducing a new function that allows the model to enter a wall-modeled LES mode.
