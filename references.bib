  abstract = {A CFD strategy is proposed that combines delayed detached-eddy simulation (DDES) with an improved RANS-LES hybrid model aimed at wall modelling in LES (WMLES). The system ensures a different response depending on whether the simulation does or does not have inflow turbulent content. In the first case, it reduces to WMLES: most of the turbulence is resolved except near the wall. Empirical improvements to this model relative to the pure DES equations provide a great increase of the resolved turbulence activity near the wall and adjust the resolved logarithmic layer to the modelled one, thus resolving the issue of "log layer mismatch" which is common in DES and other WMLES methods. An essential new element here is a definition of the subgrid length-scale which depends not only on the grid spacings, but also on the wall distance. In the case without inflow turbulent content, the proposed model performs as DDES, i.e., it gives a pure RANS solution for attached flows and a DES-like solution for massively separated flows. The coordination of the two branches is carried out by a blending function. The promise of the model is supported by its satisfactory performance in all the three modes it was designed for, namely, in pure WMLES applications (channel flow in a wide Reynolds-number range and flow over a hydrofoil with trailing-edge separation), in a natural DDES application (an airfoil in deep stall), and in a flow where both branches of the model are active in different flow regions (a backward-facing-step flow). \textcopyright{} 2008 Elsevier Inc.

  abstract = {Detached-eddy simulation (DES) was first proposed in 1997 and first used in 1999, so its full history can be surveyed. A DES community has formed, with adepts and critics, as well as new branches. The initial motivation of high\textendash{} Reynolds number, massively separated flows remains, for which DES is convincingly more capable presently than either unsteady Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) or large-eddy simulation (LES). This review discusses compelling examples, noting the visual and quantitative success of DES. Its principal weakness is its response to ambiguous grids, in which the wall-parallel grid spacing is of the order of the boundary-layer thickness. In some situations, DES on a given grid is then less accurate than RANS on the same grid or DES on a coarser grid. Partial remedies have been found, yet dealing with thickening boundary layers and shallow separation bubbles is a central challenge. The nonmonotonic response of DES to grid refinement is disturbing to most observers, as is the absence of a theoretical order of accuracy. These issues also affect LES in any nontrivial flow. This review also covers the numerical needs of DES, gridding practices, coupling with different RANS models, derivative uses such as wall modeling in LES, and extensions such as zonal DES and delayed DES.},

  abstract = {The future use of eddy resolving simulations (ERS) such as Large Eddy Simulation (LES), Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS) and related approaches in aerospace is explored. The turbulence modeling requirements with respect to aeroengines and aircraft is contrasted. For the latter, higher Reynolds numbers are more prevalent and this especially gives rise to the need for the hybridization of ERS methods with Reynolds Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) approaches. Zones where future use of pure ERS methods is now possible and those where hybridizations with RANS will be needed is outlined. The major focus is the aeroengine for which the component scales are much smaller. This gives rise to generally more benign Reynolds numbers. The use of eddy resolving methods in a wide range of zones in an aeroengine is discussed and the potential benefits and also cost drawbacks with such approaches noted. The tension when using such computationally intensive calculations in an area where the coupling of components and even the airframe and engine is becoming increasingly important is explored. Also, the numerical methods and meshing requirements are considered and the implications of ERS methods for future numerical algorithms. It is postulated that such simulations are ready now for niche uses in industry. However, to perform the scale of simulations that industry requires, to meet pressing environmental needs, challenges remain. For example, there is the need to develop optimal numerical methods that both map to the accuracy requirements for ERS and also future computer architectures.},

  abstract = {We size up the computing cost of a Large-Eddy Simulation (LES) for an airplane wing. Even with highly optimistic assumptions, the number of grid points is of the order of 10\^11 , and the number of time steps approaches 5 x 10\^6 . This is due to large areas of thin boundary layers near the leading edge. We assumed the need for only 20 grid points per boundary-layer thickness delta, in each direction, and unstructured adapted grids. We then formulate a simple strategy, based on a one-equation turbulence model, that addresses this difficulty. It reduces to Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) in the boundary layers and at separation, and to Smagorinsky-like LES downstream of separation. The intermediate region is not as well understood. The promise is to harness LES in separated regions that are very geometry-specific, while functioning with a manageable number of grid points. Preliminary exercises with what we call "Detached-Eddy Simulation" (DES) are shown. 1},

Validation studies of turbulence models in the `80th have clearly shown that most turbulence models were not capable of predicting the development of turbulent boundary layers under adverse pressure gradient conditions. Based on that observation, new models were developed to specifically meet this challenge, resulting in a series of models capable of capturing boundary layer separation in good agreement with experimental data (Johnson and King 1984, Menter 1993, Spalart and Allmaras 1994).},

  abstract = {Detached-eddy simulation (DES) is well understood in thin boundary layers, with the turbulence model in its Reynolds-averagedNavier\textendash{}Stokes (RANS) mode and flattened grid cells, and in regions of mas- sive separation, with the turbulence model in its large-eddysimulation (LES) mode and grid cells close to isotropic. However its initial formulation, denoted DES97 from here on, can exhibit an incorrect behavior in thick boundary layers and shallow separation regions. This behavior begins when the grid spacing parallel to the wall becomes less than the boundary-layer thickness {$\delta$}, either through grid refinement or bound- ary-layer thickening. The grid spacing is then fine enough for the DES length scale to follow the LES branch (and therefore lower the eddy viscosity below the RANS level), but resolved Reynolds stresses deriving from velocity fluctuations (``LES content'') have not replaced the modeled Reynolds stresses. LES content may be lacking because the resolution is not fine enough to fully support it, and/or because of delays in its generation by instabilities. The depleted stresses reduce the skin friction, which can lead to premature separation. For some research studies in small domains, is made much smaller than {$\delta$}, and LES content is generated intentionally. However for natural DES applications in useful domains, it is preferable to over-ride the DES limiter and maintain RANS behavior in boundary layers, independent of  relative to {$\delta$}. For this purpose, a newversion of the technique \textendash{} referred to as DDES, forDelayed DES \textendash{} is presentedwhich is based on a sim- ple modification to DES97, similar to one proposed by Menter and Kuntz for the shear\textendash{}stress transport (SST) model, but applicable to othermodels. Tests in boundary layers, on a single and amulti-element airfoil, a cylin- der, and a backward-facing step demonstrate thatRANSfunction is indeed maintained in thick boundary layers, without preventingLESfunction after massive separation. The newformulation better fulfills the intent ofDES. Two other issues are discussed: the use of DES as a wall model in LES of attached flows, in which the known log-layer mismatch is not resolved by DDES; and a correction that is helpful at low cell Reynolds numbers.},

  abstract = {A robust strategy for the RANS shielding of attached boundary layers in a hybrid RANS/LES context is presented, addressing two major issues. Firstly, the attached boundary layers must be detected to ensure their RANS treatment, but the original shielding function used by automatic methods such as DDES (2006) or ZDES mode 2 (2012) fails for fine meshes and/or with adverse pressure gradients, motivating the present study. Secondly, even with a stronger shielding, there should not be an excessive delay in the formation of instabilities and resolved LES content in free shear layers. Both objectives cannot be simultaneously reached by only tuning a constant in the original shielding function. The proposed new ZDES mode 2 consequently involves three main ingredients, namely a second shielding function detecting the outer part of the wake layer including with strong adverse pressure gradients, an inhibition function which switches off the second shielding when flow separation is detected, and a significant enhancement of the destruction of eddy viscosity in grey areas. The calibration of the method relies on a set of boundary layers at various Reynolds numbers and pressure gradients conditions and is confirmed by a priori tests in three-dimensional flows around curved geometries. The resulting case-independent model, the new ZDES mode 2, is assessed on four test cases, namely a flat-plate boundary layer, a mixing layer, a backward facing step and transonic buffet over a supercritical airfoil. Overall, it is shown that the new ZDES mode 2 is relevant with respect to four objectives: protection of attached boundary layers for any grid cell size (including infinite mesh refinement) and pressure gradient, RANS shielding at least as broad as the original shielding in any situation, minimum delay in the formation of resolved LES content, and full compatibility of the resulting subgrid scale model in the LES branch with the other modes of ZDES (modes 1 and 3) ensuring a continuous treatment of resolved turbulence across zones treated with different ZDES modes. The new robust ZDES mode 2 consequently is a case-independent answer to the demand for a general automatic and robust RANS/LES treatment of attached and massively separated flows.},

  abstract = {Two new two-equation eddy-viscosity turbulence models will be presented. They combine different elements of existing models that are considered superior to their alternatives. The first model, referred to as the baseline (BSL) model, utilizes the original k-\$omega\$ model of Wilcox in the inner region of the boundary layer and switches to the standard k-\$epsilon\$ model in the outer region and in free shear flows. It has a performance similar to the Wilcox model, but avoids that model's strong freestream sensitivity. The second model results from a modification to the definition of the eddy-viscosity in the BSL model, which accounts for the effect of the transport of the principal turbulent shear stress. The new model is called the shear-stress transport-model and leads to major improvements in the prediction of adverse pressure gradient flows.},
