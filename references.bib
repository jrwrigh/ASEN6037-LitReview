  abstract = {A CFD strategy is proposed that combines delayed detached-eddy simulation (DDES) with an improved RANS-LES hybrid model aimed at wall modelling in LES (WMLES). The system ensures a different response depending on whether the simulation does or does not have inflow turbulent content. In the first case, it reduces to WMLES: most of the turbulence is resolved except near the wall. Empirical improvements to this model relative to the pure DES equations provide a great increase of the resolved turbulence activity near the wall and adjust the resolved logarithmic layer to the modelled one, thus resolving the issue of "log layer mismatch" which is common in DES and other WMLES methods. An essential new element here is a definition of the subgrid length-scale which depends not only on the grid spacings, but also on the wall distance. In the case without inflow turbulent content, the proposed model performs as DDES, i.e., it gives a pure RANS solution for attached flows and a DES-like solution for massively separated flows. The coordination of the two branches is carried out by a blending function. The promise of the model is supported by its satisfactory performance in all the three modes it was designed for, namely, in pure WMLES applications (channel flow in a wide Reynolds-number range and flow over a hydrofoil with trailing-edge separation), in a natural DDES application (an airfoil in deep stall), and in a flow where both branches of the model are active in different flow regions (a backward-facing-step flow). \textcopyright{} 2008 Elsevier Inc.

  abstract = {Detached-eddy simulation (DES) was first proposed in 1997 and first used in 1999, so its full history can be surveyed. A DES community has formed, with adepts and critics, as well as new branches. The initial motivation of high\textendash{} Reynolds number, massively separated flows remains, for which DES is convincingly more capable presently than either unsteady Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) or large-eddy simulation (LES). This review discusses compelling examples, noting the visual and quantitative success of DES. Its principal weakness is its response to ambiguous grids, in which the wall-parallel grid spacing is of the order of the boundary-layer thickness. In some situations, DES on a given grid is then less accurate than RANS on the same grid or DES on a coarser grid. Partial remedies have been found, yet dealing with thickening boundary layers and shallow separation bubbles is a central challenge. The nonmonotonic response of DES to grid refinement is disturbing to most observers, as is the absence of a theoretical order of accuracy. These issues also affect LES in any nontrivial flow. This review also covers the numerical needs of DES, gridding practices, coupling with different RANS models, derivative uses such as wall modeling in LES, and extensions such as zonal DES and delayed DES.},

  abstract = {The future use of eddy resolving simulations (ERS) such as Large Eddy Simulation (LES), Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS) and related approaches in aerospace is explored. The turbulence modeling requirements with respect to aeroengines and aircraft is contrasted. For the latter, higher Reynolds numbers are more prevalent and this especially gives rise to the need for the hybridization of ERS methods with Reynolds Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) approaches. Zones where future use of pure ERS methods is now possible and those where hybridizations with RANS will be needed is outlined. The major focus is the aeroengine for which the component scales are much smaller. This gives rise to generally more benign Reynolds numbers. The use of eddy resolving methods in a wide range of zones in an aeroengine is discussed and the potential benefits and also cost drawbacks with such approaches noted. The tension when using such computationally intensive calculations in an area where the coupling of components and even the airframe and engine is becoming increasingly important is explored. Also, the numerical methods and meshing requirements are considered and the implications of ERS methods for future numerical algorithms. It is postulated that such simulations are ready now for niche uses in industry. However, to perform the scale of simulations that industry requires, to meet pressing environmental needs, challenges remain. For example, there is the need to develop optimal numerical methods that both map to the accuracy requirements for ERS and also future computer architectures.},
